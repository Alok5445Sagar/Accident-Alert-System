# Accident-Alert-System
My first IOT based project.
As we know road accidents are too prevalent in our country. Every year several deaths occur due to it. And most of these deaths occur due to not getting proper medical aid at the needful time.
With the advancement in technology, now a days most cars have advanced features to prevent the road accidents but anyhow mishap occurs. So there should be an automated system inside the car which can instantly inform the relative of the accidentee about the mishap with the proper location of accident so that they can arrange some instant medical aid to save the life of the accidentee.
So, I have designed an automated system using Arduino and GPRS Module that can be easily installed in the car and serve the required function.
